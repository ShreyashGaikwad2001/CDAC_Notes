- name in java programs is called identifier. which can be used for identification purpose
- it can be variable name ,class name, method name or label name
- ex.
	- class test{
		- //their are three identifiers in this program (test,main,string,args,x)
	- public static void main(string[] args){
		- int x=0;
		- }
	- }
-
- rules for defining java identifires
	- 1)the only allowed characters in java
		- a to z
		- A to Z
		- 0 to 9
		- _
		- $
		- IF we are using any other character we will get error
	-
	- 2)Identifiers can't start with digit.
		- ex.
			- total123-valid
			- 123total-invalid
	- 3) java identifiers are case sensitive as well as java language.
-
	- 4) in java there no length limit for  identifiers. but its not recommended to take to lengthy identifiers
-
	- 5)We cant use reserved words as identifiers.
-
	- 6)All pre-defined java class names and interface names we can use as identifiers.
		- ex
			- class test {
				- public static void main(){
					- int String=100;
					- system.out.println(String);
					- }
				- }

		- total_123-->valid
		- 123_total-->invalid
		- _$_$-->valid
		- Indexes-->valid class name/interface.
