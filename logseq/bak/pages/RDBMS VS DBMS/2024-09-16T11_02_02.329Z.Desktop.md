	- DBMS-
		- relation b/w 2  files is maintained programmatically
		  id:: 66df23e6-9295-4689-84eb-021052f648f3
		- more time required for s/w development
		  id:: 66df24ff-aa6e-4f46-8158-9368ec4a31f2
		- slow and expansive
		- locking at file level
		- high n/w traffic
		- distributed {{cloze can access data at multiple location with multiple  user is called distributed}} data base is not supported
		- not suitable for multilevel user
	- RDBMS-
		- relation b/w 2 files  can be specified at the time of tables creation
		- less time required for s/w development
		- fast and cheaper(less hardware cost less infrastructure cost and less network cost)
		- low n/w traffic
		- locking at row level(so that another person can update the second row at same time while 1st person updating the 1st row)
		- here every row is a file.
		- suitable for multilevel user.
		- distributed data base is supported
